                        us on the Services or in respect to the Services constitute the entire agreement and
                        understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision
                        of
                        these Legal Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Legal
                        Terms
                        operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and

                        damage,
                        delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision
                        or
